But if a reply is expected from a customer and the user wants it not to show up in team section and wants to followup on a more personal level the pending status is used. 08 46 AM Basit The email in pending status shows up in the personal inbox of the user as a reminder. 08 47 AM Basit Miguel did I address your query? 08 50 AM Basit Here is more information on the email status from our knowledge base article https help.hiverhq.com workingwithemails managing emails 08 53 AM Miguel miguel.soares@lovelystay.com how does it show on the personal inbox? 08 54 AM Miguel miguel.soares@lovelystay.com that I don t see 08 54 AM Miguel miguel.soares@lovelystay.com but when it is opened and assigned it s still in each person s box 08 54 AM Basit If you are available at the moment can we connect on a quick call so that I can explain it to you? 08 56 AM Basit Are we connected Miguel ? 09 01 AM Basit Thanks for using our chat service.

Some of our employees have this but others do not. Is there a fix for this? 08 48 AM Basit If I understand correctly are you referring that the emails sent from the Shared Mailbox show up in the sent section. 08 50 AM Basit Allow me to inform you that the emails sent from a Shared Mailbox are synced across all the users of the Shared Mailbox and they can see the emails in their personal sent senction. 08 51 AM Ethan ethan@storageunitsoftware.com That is correct. The hiver emails do go into the shared mailbox but they also go into some of our employees normal gmail sent folders. 08 56 AM Basit The emails that are sent using the Shared Mailbox s email address are synced across all the users of the Shared Mailbox for correct labeling which helps in showing the emails in the correct section of the Shared Mailbox. 08 57 AM Basit Thanks for using our chat service.

This is the  shared mailbox I ve set up and none of the others work this way. 09 38 AM Manoj Hello Tom 09 39 AM Tom tom@ruh.com Hi. Were you able to read my question or do I need to re type it? 09 40 AM Manoj I am checking your account set up as we speak. May I know which Shared Mailbox you are referring to? 09 41 AM Tom tom@ruh.com the latest one is Orders . This email address is an actual Gsuite user address orders@ruh.com. All the others are Groups or Aliases 09 41 AM Tom tom@ruh.com So I was wondering if that has something to do with it and if so should I change it to a Group address instead of an actual user address. 09 42 AM Manoj Please give me a moment let me confirm the scenario on my end and try to isolate this. 09 44 AM Tom tom@ruh.com ok 09 44 AM Manoj May I know if all the emails in the Orders mailbox are replied using the Shared Mailbox email address or individual s email address? 09 47 AM Tom tom@ruh.com They should be replied using the shared email address. 09 48 AM Tom tom@ruh.com But the user whose actual email is orders@ruh.com does a lot of the replies....and all the other users see those in their sent folder. 09 51 AM Manoj The emails syncing in the Sent section for all the users is an actual behaviour with Hiver. 09 52 AM Manoj Even if they are group type Shared Mailboxes or a user account it normally syncs in the Sent section. 09 53 AM Tom tom@ruh.com Should I be seeing that behavior then for the other shared mailboxes that are based on group addresses? 09 53 AM Manoj Yes. If you reply to an email using the group s email address it will be synced in the Sent section. 09 54 AM Manoj Shall we try this scenario now? 09 54 AM Tom tom@ruh.com ok....I ll have to figure out a filter for them so they can see only their own sent emails if they need to. 09 54 AM Tom tom@ruh.com Thanks...I just tested it and it s doing what you said. 09 56 AM Tom tom@ruh.com I ll work with the users to get them what they need. 09 56 AM Manoj You can use the Gmail advanced search to bring out the users s sent items. 09 57 AM Tom tom@ruh.com Thank you Manoj....I m good now.

We miss your sparkling eyes when encountering a lion for the first time your laugh when observing a baby elephant clumsily running through the plains and your happy face when you take the perfect picture to the shy leopard on the tree. These have been strange and struggling times for all of us but we are back specially now that Kenya is the first country in the world receiving SAFER TOURISM SEAL . And after several months we received our first safari adventurers! In one of these safaris we met Anthony and Ekaterina who came to Kenya for a 7 days safari covering Samburu Aberdare Lake Nakuru and Maasai Mara. What an adventure full of incredible wildlife encounters! You might be wondering how complex the process to enter Kenya during this pandemic times was but in fact it was quite a straight forward one as Anthony and Ekaterina only needed to complete the Travelers Health Surveillance Form online at https ears.health.go.ke airline registration and to show their negative test for Covid 19 test result issued at most  . Regarding the travel regulations you ll always find useful information in our FAQ. So when are you coming ?
